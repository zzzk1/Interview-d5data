        "answer": "[CLS] what percentage did the change in the proportional free cash flow from 2008 to 2009 represent in relation to that cash in 2008? [SEP] proportional free cash flow ( a non - gaap measure ) we define proportional free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less maintenance capital expenditures ( including non - recoverable environmental capital expenditures ), adjusted for the estimated impact of noncontrolling interests. the proportionate share of cash flows and related adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries comprise the proportional adjustment factor presented in the reconciliation below. upon the company ' s adoption of the accounting guidance for service concession arrangements effective january 1, 2015, capital expenditures related to service concession assets that would have been classified as investing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows are now classified as operating activities. see note 1 2014general and summary of significant accounting policies of this form 10 - k for further information on the adoption of this guidance. beginning in the quarter ended march 31, 2015, the company changed the definition of proportional free cash flow to exclude the cash flows for capital expenditures related to service concession assets that are now classified within net cash provided by operating activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows. the proportional adjustment factor for these capital expenditures is presented in the reconciliation below. we also exclude environmental capital expenditures that are expected to be recovered through regulatory, contractual or other mechanisms. an example of recoverable environmental capital expenditures is ipl ' s investment in mats - related environmental upgrades that are recovered through a tracker. see item 1. 2014us sbu 2014ipl 2014environmental matters for details of these investments. the gaap measure most comparable to proportional free cash flow is cash flows from operating activities. we believe that proportional free cash flow better reflects the underlying business performance of the company, as it measures the cash generated by the business, after the funding of maintenance capital expenditures, that may be available for investing or repaying debt or other purposes. factors in this determination include the impact of noncontrolling interests, where aes consolidates the results of a subsidiary that is not wholly - owned by the company. the presentation of free cash flow has material limitations. proportional free cash flow should not be construed as an alternative to cash from operating activities, which is determined in accordance with gaap. proportional free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary payments because it excludes certain payments that are required or to which we have committed, such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. our definition of proportional free cash [SEP]"

[SEP] the selection and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates have been discussed with our audit committee. the following is a discussion of the more significant assumptions, estimates, accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements : 2022 revenue recognition - we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery of product has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. for our company, this means that revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss is transferred to our customers. title transfers to our customers upon shipment or upon receipt at the customer ' s location as determined by the sales terms for each transaction. the company estimates the cost of sales returns based on historical experience, and these estimates are normally immaterial. 2022 goodwill and non - amortizable intangible assets valuation - we test goodwill and non - amortizable intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur that would warrant such review. we perform our annual impairment analysis in the first quarter of each year. while the company has the option to perform a qualitative assessment for both goodwill and non - amortizable intangible assets to determine if it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, the company elects to perform the quantitative assessment for our annual impairment analysis. the impairment analysis involves comparing the fair value of each reporting unit or non - amortizable intangible asset to the carrying value. if the carrying value exceeds the fair value, goodwill or a non - amortizable intangible asset is considered impaired. to determine the fair value of goodwill, we primarily use a discounted cash flow model, supported by the market approach using earnings multiples of comparable global and local companies within the tobacco industry. at december 31, 2015, the carrying value of our goodwill was $ 7. 4 billion, which is related to ten reporting units, each of which is comprised of a group of markets with similar economic characteristics. the estimated fair value of our ten reporting units exceeded the carrying value as of december 31, 2015. to determine the fair value of non - amortizable intangible assets, we primarily use a discounted cash flow model applying the relief - from - royalty method. we concluded that the fair value of our non - amortizable intangible assets exceeded the carrying value, and any reasonable movement in the assumptions would not result [SEP]"
